# Wallpaper Captain!
I want to use wallpapers that mean something to me. At first iteration, I'll set the wallpaper to a random picture from a folder in which I keep photos from various occasions in my life. Each random photo allows me to think back to a different time, state, or place I was in, and to be serendipitously reminded of its beauty.

## Pre-execution Setup
Before running the script, you must set the relevant environment variable:
`export WALLPAPER_CAPTAIN_FOLDER=/path/to/wallpapers/folder/`

## System
Run with Python 3.9.5 on Ubuntu 21.04
